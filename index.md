I am Electrical engineering major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2026.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1
This was a good first experience lab to learn about linux and how to code. I had to learn
aboyt VS code, and C++ compiler (clang++). Once I figurd it out it was pretty simple to do
and straight forward.

* Lab 10
This was one of my favorite labs because I learned a lot of new thing from it. I learned
about vector code, and how to organize data through it, it was a fun and i had a good 
experience learning new things.

* Lab 11
In this lab I learned how to deal with an object oriented class. It was a straight forward
lab I just followed the TODO and edited the file using VS code, then I had to use "make" to find any errors and see if it works or not. Easy step by step Lab.
